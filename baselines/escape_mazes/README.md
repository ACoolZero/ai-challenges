## Challenge Title: Autonomous Maze Explorer

### Challenge Description:
Welcome to the Autonomous Maze Explorer challenge! As an AI developer, your task is to create an intelligent agent that can navigate through a maze environment autonomously. Your AI agent should be able to explore the maze, avoid obstacles, and find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal.

### Challenge Requirements:

- **Maze Environment:** You will be provided with a 2D grid-based maze environment. The maze will consist of walls, open paths, a starting point, and a goal point. The maze layout will vary in complexity.

- **Autonomous Navigation:** Develop an AI algorithm that can control a virtual agent to explore the maze autonomously. The agent should use sensor data or available information to make decisions about movement.

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Your AI agent should be able to detect and avoid walls and obstacles while navigating through the maze. Colliding with walls or obstacles will result in a penalty.

- **Pathfinding:** Implement a pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal. You can choose from algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, or any other suitable algorithm.

- **Visualization:** Create a visualization of the maze exploration process and the path taken by the AI agent. This visualization can be in the form of a graphical interface or a step-by-step textual representation.

- **Scoring:** Your AI agent's performance will be evaluated based on factors such as exploration efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and the accuracy of the shortest path found.

### Submission Guidelines:

- **Code:** Submit the source code of your AI algorithm along with any necessary instructions to run the program.

- **Documentation:** Include a brief document describing your approach, the algorithms used, any challenges faced, and how you tackled them.

- **Visualization:** Provide the visualization of your AI agent's exploration and pathfinding process. Explain how to interpret the visualization.

- **Performance Analysis:** Present an analysis of your AI agent's performance in terms of exploration efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and pathfinding accuracy.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Functionality:** Does your AI agent successfully explore the maze, avoid obstacles, and find the shortest path from start to goal?

- **Efficiency:** How efficiently does your AI agent explore the maze and find the shortest path? Does it use appropriate algorithms and techniques?

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** How effectively does your AI agent avoid obstacles and collisions during exploration?

- **Code Quality:** Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand? Can others easily grasp your implementation?

- **Innovation:** Did you apply any creative or innovative approaches in solving the challenge?
